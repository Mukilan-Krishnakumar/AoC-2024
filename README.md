# Advent of Code 2024
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent Calendar of small programming puzzles which begins on December 1st and ends on Christmas day. 

It is a fun way to pick up a new language or sharpen your skills in your favorite language. 

This year, I am solving AoC puzzles in Python and Golang. 

Python to quickly get to the solution (kindled competitive spirit) and once again in Golang to discover the language quirks. 

It is always fun to compete in this, even though I usually only get till single digit days :)
